## General Information
The project uses the house sales data set to prepare a model with the available independent variables. Company is Surprise Housing one of the US housing company. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

## Conclusions
Using GridSearchCV the model arrives at a final optimum lambda to determine the house prices using ridge and lasso regression.

## Technologies Used
Python Libraries are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, sklearn, statsmodels and Plotly
